# Current Work - CommandCentered Development

**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025 at 12:00 PM EST
**Current Phase:** 🚨 BLOCKED - Google Drive Folder Management

---

## 🚨 CURRENT SESSION (Nov 23 - BLOCKED)

**What Was Attempted:**
Google Drive folder management feature for Deliverables - fully coded but blocked by MCP and file lock issues.

**Work Completed (Code Only):**
- ✅ Schema Changes: Added `googleDriveFolderId` and `googleDriveFolderUrl` to Deliverable model (schema.prisma:915-917)
- ✅ tRPC Procedure: Created `updateGoogleDriveFolder` mutation (deliverable.ts:178-196)
- ✅ UI Implementation: Complete Google Drive folder section in DeliverableDetailModal (deliverables/page.tsx:469-727)
  - State management for edit mode
  - URL parsing to extract folder IDs
  - Edit/view mode interface with tactical theme styling

**Blockers:**
1. 🚫 Supabase MCP authorization failed (3+ attempts) - Cannot execute SQL migrations
2. 🚫 Prisma client generation EPERM file lock errors (3+ attempts) - Windows file lock on query_engine DLL
3. 🚫 Prisma db push database connection error - Stale prepared statements

**Status:** 🚨 **BLOCKED** - Manual intervention required (see BLOCKER_20251123_GoogleDriveMigration.md)

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix Supabase MCP authorization OR manually add database columns
2. Clear Windows file locks and regenerate Prisma client
3. Build and test feature
