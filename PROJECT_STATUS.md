## 🆕 PHASE 0 LEAD GENERATION (Nov 16)

2. **Campaigns** - Multi-step email sequences
   - 4-step sequence builder (Initial → Follow-up → Value add → Final)
   - Email tracking (opens, clicks, replies)
   - Per-step analytics (sent, opened, replied %)
   - Conditional logic (NO_REPLY, NO_OPEN, CLICKED_LINK)

3. **Pipeline Integration** - Auto-move replied leads
   - Replied leads → Automatically added to Pipeline as "New Lead"
   - Source tracking: "Email Campaign - Spring Recital 2025"
   - Email activity timeline in Lead detail

### **Database Changes:**
- **5 new models:** LeadSource, Campaign, CampaignStep, CampaignLead, EmailActivity
- **4 new enums:** CampaignStatus, StepCondition, CampaignLeadStatus, EmailActivityType
- **273 lines added** to schema.prisma

### **Costs & ROI:**
- **Monthly:** $134 (Apollo.io $99 + Mailgun $35)
